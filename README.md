## Prerequisites

- Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or later
- JDK 17+
- Android SDK 35
- A device or emulator with API 26+

---

## Installation

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BardinConsulting/ebooks.git
cd ebooks
```

### 2. Quick Start (One-Shot)

Build and install APK automatically — no questions asked:

```bash
./setup.sh                 # Build v1.0.0, auto-install if device connected
./setup.sh 1.2.3           # Build v1.2.3
./setup.sh 1.2.3 42        # Build v1.2.3 with code=42
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Builds APK with Docker automatically
- ✅ Downloads to `~/.ebooks-apk/` (persistent folder)
- ✅ Auto-installs on connected Android device
- ✅ Shows ready-to-install APK path
- ✅ Zero interaction

### 3a. Build with Docker (Manual Control)

Build a release APK using Docker — works on any system with Docker installed.

```bash
# Debug APK
./scripts/build-apk-docker.sh

# Release APK with custom version
./scripts/build-apk-docker.sh 1.2.3

# Release APK with version and code
./scripts/build-apk-docker.sh 1.2.3 42
```

The APK will be in `./release/`.

**Advantages:**
- ✅ No local Android SDK installation needed
- ✅ Matches CI/CD environment exactly
- ✅ Reproducible builds across machines
- ✅ Clean isolation (no system contamination)

### 3b. Build Locally (without Docker)

#### Step 3b-i: Generate Gradle wrapper (first time only)

```bash
# If you have Gradle 8.7 installed globally:
gradle wrapper

# Or use Android Studio's "Sync Project" button
```

#### Step 3b-ii: Build debug APK

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The APK will be at `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### 4. Install on Device (Manual)

```bash
# From setup.sh
adb install ~/.ebooks-apk/EbookReader-v1.0.0.apk

# From Docker build
adb install ./release/EbookReader-v1.0.0.apk

# From local build
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Or open in Android Studio and click **Run**.

## Branch Protection (configure manually on GitHub)

Go to **Settings → Branches** and add rules for:

| Branch | Rules |
|--------|-------|
| `main` | Require PR, require CI green, no force push, require linear history |
| `develop` | Require PR, require CI green |

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`
3. Commit with Conventional Commits: `git commit -m "feat: add night mode"`
4. Push and open a PR against `develop`
5. Ensure all CI checks pass

### Commit Convention

```
feat:     new feature
fix:      bug fix
docs:     documentation only
refactor: code restructure without behavior change
test:     adding/updating tests
ci:       CI/CD configuration
chore:    build system, dependency updates
```
